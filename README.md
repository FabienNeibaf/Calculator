# :hash: Calculator

This is an evolving calculator that takes a mathematical expression and evaluates it.
In the core, it:
- Takes the user input,
- Normalizes it,
- Creates an expression object from the normalized input, and
- Evaluates the expression.  

I planned to make it more complex but it's a start.
